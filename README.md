No-Frills Tokenizer
===================

This tokenizer is basically a set of rules and a pair of functions.  It does nothing fancy and therefore may make some rules more complex than they need to be.  It doesn't do streaming or anything else like that, though you can wrap it in a stream or other such thing if you want.
